To extract meaning from the large amount of data you’ve collected, you will usually need to analyze your data through statistical techniques. In doing so, you can find trends, patterns, or the absence of such, all in order to answer your central research question. Below, we cover some commonly-used statistical analysis techniques in science. Note, however, that this is not a comprehensive list and you should research field-specific analyses for your project.  

Error Propagation
========

Nearly all experiments contain some form of error. Behavioral science research has uncertainties in the assumed parameters of the target population. Astrophysics research contains errors in the observed quantities. Even modeling projects take into account the inevitable error resulting from instrument noise and scatter in the simulation parameters. Our world is often messy, and as a result, so is our data. In order to be honest about the accuracy of our experiment and the veracity of our results, we need to propagate the errors from various contributors through to our final data.

When computing a parameter, it is important to consider all of the sources of error that could have skewed its value. What is the error range of my measuring device? What is the error contributed by the assumed mathematical simplifications during calculations? Once you have the individual errant contributors, you can calculate the total error in a variety of ways, including:

* Adding up each of the components
* Dividing the sum of the components over the value of the estimated parameter (relative error)
* Multiplying the components
* A weighted error depending on the value of each of the components

Descriptive vs Inferential Statistics
==============

Your choice of analysis paradigm depends on the question you are trying to answer–are you trying to determine the value of a statistic from a sample (e.g. mean, median, standard deviation) or are you trying to test a particular hypothesis for its validity? If the former, you want to use descriptive statistics, and if the former, you’ll want to use inferential methods. **Keep in mind that most research projects usually contain a mix of both elements.**

Descriptive Statistics
--------------------
Descriptive statistics are a subfield of statistics that focuses on obtaining specific values for parameters (means, medians, modes, standard deviations). These are useful for answering questions about the characteristics of a population. Below are some examples of studies in which descriptive statistics would be useful. In the following section, we will discuss parameters used in descriptive statistics. 

.. tip::
    What is the mean viscosity of various ketchup brands?

.. tip::
    What is the standard deviation in shoe size for Mount Everest climbers?

.. tip::
    What is the median grade in humanities classes for math majors?


Inferential Statistics
------------------

Inferential statistics are a subclass of statistics which deal with making inferences based on the available data. Inferential statistics usually involve trying to prove a particular hypothesis or answer a particular question based on a certain significance/confidence level. Below are some examples of studies that can be answered through inferential techniques. 

.. tip::
    Is there a statistically significant difference between the proportion of cat lovers in those who use the Internet regularly and those who don’t?

.. tip::
    Is the number density of stars at various points in a galactic halo not constant?

.. tip::
    Is there a statistically-significant difference between the proportion of college students who work a side job that have over a $20k yearly income and those that have below a $20k yearly income?

Each inferential test will output a test statistic, which can then be compared to their parent distribution to determine a “p-value,” or the likelihood that you obtained the result that you got given that the null (default) hypothesis is true. If this p-value is less than a chosen alpha level (traditionally 0.05), you can reject the null hypothesis and say you’ve found evidence for the alternate hypothesis. The null hypothesis is typically designed as the base assumption (everything is equal), whereas the alternate hypothesis is testing a difference between two distributions. The alternate hypothesis should not be used for testing equality. 

.. tip::

    **Null Hypothesis**: The proportion of brown M&Ms and yellow M&Ms in all M&M bags is equal.

    **Alternate Hypothesis**: The proportion of brown M&Ms is greater than the proportion of yellow M&Ms in all M&M bags.

    In this scenario, you would likely use a z-test for proportions (see Statistical Tests). If you received a p-value < 0.05, you could claim:

    Since the obtained p-value is less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. There is evidence to support that the proportion of brown M&Ms is greater than the proportion of yellow M&Ms in all M&M bags.

    If your p-value was greater than 0.05, you’d say:

    Since the obtained p-value is greater than 0.05, we are unable to reject the null hypothesis.  There is not sufficient evidence to support that the proportion of brown M&Ms is greater than the proportion of yellow M&Ms in all M&M bags.

Statistical Parameters
====================

Below we list some common parameters (and their formulae) that may be useful to calculate for descriptive statistics:

Mean: The average value of a sample.

.. math::

   \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} x_i

Median: The center of a sample.

.. math::

   \begin{cases} 
   x_{\left(\frac{N+1}{2}\right)}, & \text{if } N \text{ is odd} \\
   \frac{1}{2} \left( x_{\left(\frac{N}{2}\right)} + x_{\left(\frac{N}{2}+1\right)} \right), & \text{if } N \text{ is even}
   \end{cases}

Standard Deviation: A measure for the variability of a sample.

.. math::

   \sigma = \sqrt{\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (x_i - \mu)^2}

Statistical Tests
================
Below are some commonly used inferential tests. Remember that all of these tests have their own inferential requirements and that it is your responsibility to make sure that you’re properly using them:

**Student’s t-test**: Used to test the null hypothesis of there being no difference between the means of two populations.

**ANOVA**: Used to test if there is a difference between the means of two or more populations

**Z-test for proportions**: Used to test if there is a difference in the proportions of two populations

**Sign test/Wilcoxon’s Signed Rank Test**: Used to determine if the median of a dataset equals a certain value

**Mann-Whitney Test**: Used to test whether the median of one population is different than the median of another

**Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test**: Used to test if two samples are drawn from the same population

**Chi-square Test**: Used to test if the distribution of sample proportions for two populations are the same.
