<p>As part of the scientific community, all research is put into a pool of information that other scientists use to start their projects exploring the natural world. Because of this, it is essential that each piece of information available in various journals and other scientific resources is accurate and the product of the scientific method. As an aspiring researcher yourself, it is your responsibility to ensure the veracity and accuracy of your data.</p>

<p>In some cases, researchers may be dishonest with their data, leading to data manipulation, p-hacking, fabrication, and more, just so that their results seem significant and paper seems to have a positive impact on the community. However, this causes subsequent research based on the previous paper to be invalidated due to the incorrectness of the results. As you can imagine, if this goes on for a long time, years and years of research can be declared invalid just because of a piece of false information. In addition to the great setback in science, if discovered, your paper will be taken down from every journal, and you will almost certainly lose every opportunity to find another opportunity to conduct research. Due to this endless chain reaction that may occur, as stated before, it’s essential that you keep integrity and honestly a major value while conducting research, and sharing honest results.</p>

<p class="admonition-title">Example</p>
<p>A professor from a distinguished university is conducting cancer research. He comes up with a hypothesis that a newly discovered drug, that the professor himself invented, would cause malignant tumors to become benign, and allow them to be surgically removed safely. He ran some tests on a few human subjects and found that the pill worked on 3 out of 10 of the subjects. Because the pill worked on at least 1 individual, he decided to manipulate his data to suggest that the pill worked on every individual. Days later, this new discovery spread worldwide and the professor’s name was widespread. Different researchers also started using his new drugs as a medium for their research, and created supplementary medicines to be used along with it. However, when the treatment started being used, problems were discovered. The drug started to cause tumors to become even larger, and the supplementary medicines based off the original pill were also harmful, due to the false assumption that the initial pill was working. This caused uproar in the world, when society thought that cancer would no longer be an issue. Cancer research was offset by many months, and the professor was forced to leave the prestigious university, never finding a job in academia again.</p>

<p>Sometimes, readers may have a different interpretation of the data analysis done in a specific research paper. Although this may not be intentional, it can still cause the research to be misinterpreted and lead to future problems in the same field. The best way to minimize any misinterpretation in your results is to be explicit and direct in your methodology and data analysis sections. You need to be specific with the methods of analysis you use, how you as a researcher interpret these findings, and if the interpretation would be scientifically acceptable. To do this, you would include information about the type of test that you are carrying out, what your hypotheses mean in relation to significance, and other results that should be included in your paper.</p>

<p>There are many ways in which scientific data can be manipulated in a way that can be considered “unethical,” and certainly different people draw the line at various places. However, it is important to have a holistic understanding of the behaviors that are commonly recognized as unethical. Beginner researchers without a good understanding of research ethics sometimes unintentionally engage in behavior that could inadvertently jeopardize the integrity of their research as a whole, even if they never had the intent to exercise unethical practices. Therefore, when starting your research journey, it is especially important to be conscious of whether the way you assess your data falls outside of the ethical realm.</p>
<section id="data-omission-and-manipulation">
<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5" role="doc-backlink">Data Omission and Manipulation</a><a class="headerlink" href="#data-omission-and-manipulation" title="Link to this heading" x-intersect.margin.0%.0%.-70%.0%="activeSection = '#data-omission-and-manipulation'"><span>#</span></a></h3>
<p>The primary essence of scientific research is to find answers to challenging questions that eventually will contribute to the advancement of the respective fields. As such, almost all the time, there are more “negative” than “positive” data points during the journey of a research project. However, beginners often struggle with these negative and positive data points. Often, researchers are so passionate about their scientific hypotheses and are desperate to prove them, or at least produce some meaningful result. Therefore, data that doesn’t support their thinking, “negative” data, is often ignored or downplayed. On the other hand, any pieces of data that could offer some hope in supporting their theories, “positive data,” tends to be over-amplified. The result of this subtle push and pullback is that during the final presentation of the data in a paper, negative data is frequently left out or pushed into the background, while positive data is “optimized” to show the “best quality.” However, in science, negative results are equally, if not more valuable than positive results, and these tempting yet harmful behaviors often lead to unfortunate outcomes for young, energetic researchers. Experts in the field are frequently able to easily spot data omission and manipulation, and the researchers, motivated mostly by passion, end up being labeled as unethical researchers, and their reputations tarnished.</p>
<p>A simple yet impactful way that a researcher can avoid accidentally omitting or manipulating negative data points is to force themselves to critically review data in its totality. If possible, talk to yourself in the role of an independent reviewer rather than a scientist; ask yourself “mean” questions that are intended to expose flaws in your data reporting. You can also present your data and explain your rationales behind how you are analyzing and handling the data to a third party. Many scientists find that explaining the reasoning behind their data handling helps to ensure a good chance of unbiased and proper analysis.</p>

<h3><a class="toc-backref" href="#id6" role="doc-backlink">Data Fabrication</a><a class="headerlink" href="#data-fabrication" title="Link to this heading" x-intersect.margin.0%.0%.-70%.0%="activeSection = '#data-fabrication'"><span>#</span></a></h3>
<p>All scientists, and all humans make mistakes. Science is imperfect, and advancement is rarely a straight line, often taking twists and turns with very little progress. While frustrating as it can be, data fabrication is a much more serious ethical issue that should never be considered by any researcher. Unlike data omission and manipulation, data fabrication can never be played off for any reason outside of fulfilling a personal agenda not linked in any way to authentic science. Changing numerical values of experimental results, adding or removing contents of a figure, and outrightly false detailing of experimental procedures are among the many ways that data fabrication can manifest itself. Such behaviors are a total deviation from the fundamental guidance of being a true scientific researcher: good data or bad data, it is the primary source of truth and should never be changed, and those who do so should be dealt with serious ramifications.</p>
<p>With the advancement of digital technologies over the last 20 years, data fabrication has unfortunately become significantly easier to executive without obvious traces. More than ever, this brings a real ethical challenge to young researchers often under tremendous pressure to turn out results to secure funding, meet a timeline, or many other reasons. Despite this, one should always remind themselves- while it may seem like an easy way out, an act like data fabrication is wholly unethical, against the fundamental rules of scientific research, and will ruin careers and destroy reputations sooner rather than later.</p>

<p>Despite the rigor and depth to which modern scientific research is scrutinized, incidents of unethical research practices still do occur, and sometimes they can result in high-profile scandals that tarnish the perpetrator’s reputation, career, and livelihood. Evidence of such practices can emerge years after the alleged acts were committed, and while papers can be retracted and revised, trust is much harder to restore.</p>

<p>In competitions such as ISEF or JSHS that offer millions of dollars in total prize money and great boosts to student college applications, there is great incentive for scientific fraud and misconduct. Indeed, there have been few cases of misconduct that have been caught, but due to the relatively low rigor of scientific examination at these competitions in comparison to groups of SMEs (subject matter experts) at institutions like journals, the fraction of misconduct is likely higher. However, there are consequences for those that are caught, and a simple Google search will reveal cases of such occurrences in student research. These students are often ostracized and called out in front of the entire student research community, if not in front of a wider audience. Scientific misconduct can not only cause drastic effects in works that cite and rely on your research, but it can also result in devastating personal consequences for the culprit.</p>
