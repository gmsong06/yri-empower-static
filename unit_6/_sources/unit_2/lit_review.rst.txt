Welcome to the literature review. This is one of the most daunting processes to new researchers because it’s easy to get lost. Trust us, we have been there. This guide is going to tell you EVERYTHING you need to know about the literature review, and give you tips that experts and the most successful researchers use to publish papers, win competitions, and make a tangible impact. 

If you haven't already, read the preliminary literature review guide we made which will help you get an idea on how to do a literature review before you have a research question in mind. This guide is for mastering the literature review once you have a research question: `Preliminary Literature Review <../unit_1/prelim_lit_review.html>`_.

First, take a deep breath and let’s get started.

What is a literature review? The real and concrete definition.
------------------------------------------------
A literature review is the process in which we learn what has already been done by reading many research papers and assessing the information available online. This allows us to gain an understanding of our field and improve our knowledge over our own project, which is critical to the research and scientific method.

What will we cover in this lesson?

- How to complete a literature review once you have a research question: Zero to Mastery Literature Review Guide
- Tools to conduct the Literature review and “hack” the process
- Expert advice and key tips
- Frequently asked questions

How to Complete a Literature Review Once You have a Research Question: Zero to Mastery
---------------------------------
At this point, you should have a research question or challenge that you are interested in. If you do not, please review `Preliminary Literature Review <../unit_1/prelim_lit_review.html>`_ and relevant lessons in Unit 1. Also, ask our custom research assistant `NighShade <https://yri-gilt.vercel.app/nightshade>`_ for help as needed.

Now that you have a research question, we need to define a few concepts before jumping straight into the literature review. This will help us further in the process. 

**What is your educated hypothesis?**

- An educated hypothesis is one you make to the best of your ability at the beginning of your project. This is an initial “guess” to the answer of your research question. For instance, if your research question is “Is there a way to diagnose Parkinson's disease in a more accessible and accurate way?”, then your hypothesis may be “I hypothesize that a tool can be developed that will diagnose Parkinson’s more accurately and more accessible.” Note that this is a very general hypothesis but as we continue through our methodology we will continue to refine it. 

**What is your framed research question?**

- A framed research question is one you will make to identify the gap in the literature and as specifically as possible. An example would be “Is there a more quantitative manner to analyze Parkinson's Disease without in person observation while also maintaining accuracy?”

Taking note of these 2 terms will allow us to confront the literature review process easier. Now that we have those covered, let’s continue to the complete literature review.

Step 1. Search for Relevant Literature
--------------------------

1. Breaking down the Research Question: 
===============================

Finding relevant literature from your research question is very important. You can do this by finding themes in your question. Researchers will do this by breaking the research question down into its elemental parts. 

Sticking with the research question “Is there a more quantitative manner to analyze Parkinson's Disease without in person observation while also maintaining accuracy?”, we can practice breaking this down into its sub-themes. Some noticeable themes here are Parkinson's disease diagnosis, accessibility challenges in health care, accurate diagnosis of Parkinson’s, technology to diagnose Parkinson’s. 

By separating your research question into many more questions, we can begin to understand the current state of the world and also the **state of the art (SOTA)**.

**State of the art (SOTA)**: This is a key vocabulary term you will always hear when doing research. State of the art means "What is the best method/solution existent today?”

We will have an entire lesson dedicated to SOTA very soon and we will delve further into assessing it and how to easily navigate the challenges of identifying and analyzing SOTA.

2. Where to search and what to look for?
================================

Now, you may have searched for some of the key topics and ideas that you found aligned with your research question.

A rule of thumb is to read the information that comes up in the initial search. As you can notice above, this is redirecting me to some articles from Mayo Clinic and this may be useful. However, we don’t just want to look from google because the latest research papers may not have popped up. 

Therefore, we use the following strategy:

- Do a google search and read the top results. 
- Then do a google scholar search (https://scholar.google.com/)  and scroll through the recommended research papers. Assess if they are relevant (do they seem interesting or related to your research question) and write down a list to read. Here is an example of a google scholar search if you have never done one: 

.. image:: images/google_scholar.png
        :width: 100%
        :align: center

This provides you with tons of interesting papers that will certainly be useful! Make a list of papers for each part of your research question; we want to cover all bases!

Step 2. Reading a Research Paper! The Smart Way
---------------------------------------

Now that we have created a list of papers we want to read, we now need to begin reading each one. Spoiler alert! Not all the information in the papers is going to be helpful. Here is how we suggest going through the research paper to save time and maximize information:

Organizing and recalling what you read: The Perfect Template
==============================

This template will make organizing and recalling the information much easier! Make a copy of this so you can also use it!

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U-XSuD8CRM8uj8lAMJB5BJCR8WAEx3HWm_SSXFKc0dw/edit?usp=sharing

This information will become very useful when you are writing your research paper or looking back on your notes. This template is broken up into a few key parts:

- **Paper info**: Include the name of the paper and the authors who wrote, that you are about to read
- **Key Takeaways**: What was interesting about this paper? What did they discover or notice? And most importantly, what gaps were there in their literature? What did they want to work on in the future
- **New Vocabulary**: Any new terms that you learned? If so, it is worthwhile to write the word and definition down in the table at the bottom of this document!
- **Additional Sources**: We will often read important information from websites or even wikipedia, that aren’t classified as a research paper. You can enter what you learned in the additional sources section here. 
- **Week and Summary**: Reviewing and summarizing what you have learned across multiple papers is super important! It takes practice and skill to be able to summarize knowledge across multiple papers but this pushes you to think about the bigger picture, and mastering this skill will build your comprehension skills greatly. We discuss the importance of this further below. 

Why do we do this? A number of reasons!

- This information will be used when we write sections of our own research papers to potentially publish!
- This allows us to reference quickly past literature when we forget something we read
- This allows us to develop a clean and organized research journal that can be useful to look back on and show others! This also allows us to track how much we have learned and grown over our research journeys.  

1. Reading the Paper: Read the Abstract:
===================================

Research papers are extensive and can be overwhelming when we begin. There are so many parts to one such as the abstract, introduction, methodology, results, conclusions, and discussions!!! How do we begin to tackle this paper? 

First, Read the Abstract! The abstract of every paper is available typically at the top of it, and this gives us the condensed form of the paper from the introduction to the results and conclusions. This will let you know what you're getting into, and also let you decide “Do I want to continue with reading this?/ Is this useful?” 

The abstract will typically include summaries of the introduction, brief methodology, and key results. It will also include terms that may be unknown to you and when first starting, it can be worthwhile to use tools such as ChatGPT to better understand the abstract or terms in it that are unknown to you. Over time, you will begin understanding more and more terms and reading abstracts will become even quicker and easier.

2. Read the Introduction
============================

If you read the abstract and want to proceed with this paper, believing it is useful, then the next place to visit on the paper is the introduction.

The introduction will include an explanation over the field as a whole, the gap in the literature that the research paper is trying to address, and an in depth explanation over past research. 

This section can be challenging to understand at first, but is very important in early stages to get a grasp on the field you are looking at and what has been done. To navigate difficult names and terms, use ChatGPT, google searches, and Wikipedia to understand the topic better. Take advantage of AI to break it down quickly! It’s completely normal to feel lost in your first several research papers. It just means there is more to learn which is exciting. Make sure to include what you learn and read in https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U-XSuD8CRM8uj8lAMJB5BJCR8WAEx3HWm_SSXFKc0dw/edit?usp=sharing. When reading a research paper introduction, you may end up needing to read 5-6 more sources! That’s the fun about this, it is a rabbit hole of a process. 

**At the end of your introduction, try and write a summary of it in 2-3 sentences and include it in your literature review document! This can be challenging to condense the information this much, but will let you know if you have a real grasp over the material.** 

3. Read the Conclusion
===========================

Survived the Introduction? Awesome, now we can move onto the next part: The Conclusion! This might seem unintuitive. 

Why are we moving from the introduction straight to the conclusion? What about the Methodology and Results? The reason we skip these parts is because they are incredibly technical and often include components that are not very useful when we are trying to get the main information from the research paper. There will be times where those sections are important, but in our literature review, diving this deep isn’t necessary. When we do our technical dive in the midst of carrying out our methodology, these sections will be more important. We will discuss how to do this in a later lesson. 

So how do we read the conclusion? Very similar to the introduction, we will try and get the main points. The conclusion will summarize the results and relate it back to the research question. 

Again, create a 1-3 sentence summary of the conclusion and add it to the literature review document. Some papers do not have a conclusion section specifically. Instead, you will go straight to the discussion. 

4. Read the Discussion
========================

The Discussion is often overlooked when doing research, yet it is arguably the most important section. This part of a research paper reviews the results in context of the entire field and discusses future plans and areas for improvement. Ring any bells? This sounds a lot like an area for improvement and potentially another research question! 

This is why the discussion is so important. It tells us, the reader, where we can improve and also opens up potential new topics for research.

You will similarly summarize the discussion in 1-3 sentences in your literature review, focusing on the area for potential improvement. 

After reading several papers, you will begin to notice trends in the areas for improvements which can become a strong supporting factor for your research question or a new research question. 

Step 3. Repeating the Process and Additional Tips to Mastering the Process
---------------------------------

Repeat, Revise, Summarize: When Do I “Stop”
=======================================

The process of reading the abstract —> introduction —> conclusion —> discussion, and summarizing it in your literature review document will happen many times. So, when do I stop? Let’s answer this question by looking at the research process and where literature review is involved:

- **Finding A Main topic and Subtopic of Interest**: There is some basic literature review involved here but not as extensive
- **Developing a Research Question and Hereypothesis**: We are now looking more in the literature and conducting a Preliminary literature review
- **Post Research Question and Understanding the Context of our Research Question**: Here, a deep dive into the literature is conducted.
- **Developing a Research Plan**: Literature review into the current methods, existing solutions, and timeline
- **Learning and Conducting the Methodology**: Literature review in understanding techniques + Reading papers to assess other methodologies
- **Conclusions + Results + Data Analysis**: Literature review involved here to understand your data in context

So, the answer is you don’t. The literature review is involved everywhere and progresses to the next step of the process when you have enough information to be confident in your actions.

In this case, you will stop the literature review for post-research questions, when you have enough information to develop a research rationale. We will discuss that in depth in the next document!

The goal of this literature review is to gain enough knowledge to be confident that what you are researching is important and valuable. At this stage, we want to understand the field, current methods, and how our research question ties into the big picture. This process continues throughout your entire journey and you will constantly be adding to your literature review document!

The Step that Makes It or Breaks It
================================

Good practice does not just involve reading the papers and documenting them, but also taking time to review what you have learned. Many people, when doing research and preparing for competitions or conferences, will forget to understand and review the literature you read months ago! This process is not as daunting as it may initially sound. Here is how to go about your review regime:

You can reread the week’s notes in your literature review document once every week. This allows you to get a grasp on the knowledge and refresh your mind on what you have learned. A skillful and true researcher is not only able to understand a single research paper, but they are able to read multiple papers and make a generalization! 

There is a section in your literature review notes called “Week and Summary”. Each week it is important to review all your notes over the papers you read and write a paragraph (3-4 sentences) about what you learned from these papers. This involves you looking for faint trends in all your notes and making a claim over them all. Doing this sets beginner and experienced researchers apart.

An experienced and skillful researcher is able to understand the papers they read in the context of the field, and this step of reviewing what you have learned and tying them together allows you to reach that stage. 

Don’t Just Read Papers! Read NEWS
================================

During this entire document, we have been emphasizing the importance of reading research papers related to your research question and accessing external sources to understand it. It’s a common misconception that you should only read what you are researching and nothing else.

This is beyond wrong. Successful and top researchers will not only read their field, but will also keep an eye on the field as a whole. By searching up “AI News + Hot-topics”, and engaging in discussions with a mentor or perhaps parent, you can begin to understand how the field as a whole is progressing. For instance, an AI expert will understand the current advances in AI and what the hot topics are. You should be a master of your niche, yes, but you should also be able to discuss things out of your comfort zone. This is what is truly impressive. Take time to stay up-to-date on current topics of your field and emerging technologies or methods that are gaining traction.

It really does pay off!

Tools to Conduct and “Hack” The Literature Review Process
------------------------------------------
Before diving into the literature review process, take a look at these tools and “hacks” researchers use to maximize their time, comprehension, and efficiency. We suggest you download these and test them out!

**1. NightShade/ChatGPT**
Many of us know ChatGPT and the power of it, but many underestimate its usefulness in the research process. This is why the Youth Research Initiative created NighShade, your personal research assistant. NightShade can answer any questions about research and help you find topics of interest. It can also provide you an answer to practically any literature question and speed up your understanding.

**2. Use Typeset.io! https://typeset.io/**
This is the ultimate literature review tool and can save you hours of time. Use this to quickly learn topics and test it out yourself to see how it fits into your research journey. This tool can make it easy to search up a topic and get insight from tons of papers, speeding up the literature review process. You can also upload PDFs and chat with them to ask questions specific about the paper you are reading. Along with this, you can generate citations from it and do even more!

**3. Paperpile: https://paperpile.com/app**
This is a super popular citation tool amongst researchers! This allows you to add papers to your paperpile and store them for when you need to cite it in your research paper or read later. You can also share papers with others using paperpile. The chrome extension of this makes it even easier to add papers. 

The above tools are our top 3 suggested when you begin the research process, and will often be all you need! By utilizing them in combination with reading and assessing papers, you can speed up your research process and “hack” it. 

**4. Mendeley: https://www.mendeley.com/**
Mendeley is a popular citations tool to find articles and also cite them! It’s a popular a great tool to use. 

**5. SciHub: https://sci-hub.se/**
SciHub is one of the most popular tools in the research community. Many papers today are paywalled, making them difficult to access for the general public. Therefore, scihub was developed to alleviate this challenge and give access to papers that are behind a subscription/paywall. However, this is illegal so use it at your own discretion. 

Expert Tips We Have Compiled
---------------------------

Below are the top 3 expert tips we have gotten from several youth researchers and professors:

- Do not forget your research question in context. When you are reading papers and assessing the literature, always relate it back to your central research question. 
- Understand research in context of the big picture. You should learn hot-topics and follow content creators or social media accounts that post about them regularly. Being up-to-date is helpful more times than you will realize now
- Reach out to help when you need it. Join discord servers, email professors, and ask your parents or school faculty for assistance when you need it. This shows your initiative and willingness to take the additional step. Asking for help is so natural and critical! You learn so much more from people around you than you will from any research paper. 

Conclusion
--------------

The literature review is one of the most fundamental aspects of research and mastering this process is what often separates a novice from an experienced researcher. The concepts above from the step by step process to the specialized tools and templates to use will help you gain years of experience in moments. Through practice and developing your own style, you can set the fundamental path towards success. 

FAQs
--------

In this section we have compiled some frequently asked questions related to the literature review:

**Q:** How do I manage the overwhelming amount of literature on a subject? 

**A:** Make sure you have a clear and narrowed down research question. If you think it’s too broad and difficult to find specific literature, you may want to break it down further! Make sure that you are not keeping your searches too broad and try to make them as specific as possible! Read the abstracts to check for relevance, and organize using our literature review template!

|

**Q:** How do I find gaps in the literature if it doesn't explicitly state it? 

**A:** This is a great question! Often, you need to look for synonyms such as “limiting”, “challenge”, “future work”, “unfortunately”. These key-words will bring forth areas for improvement and gaps in the literature. If your paper doesn’t include even these, you may want to look into a different paper however most of the time limitations will be listed. 

|

**Q:** How do I handle a lack of literature on a topic? 

**A:** This is a challenging situation you may run into, but it can also be a good thing! First, try and broaden your search. Sometimes it is too specific and yield little responses so expanding it a bit can provide more useful information. The next best thing you can do is contact an expert to learn more. Little literature can be valuable as there is more area for research to be done!

|

**Q:** How do I make sure my literature review is not biased? 

**A:** Make sure to read literature from multiple sources. If you find yourself looking at research papers in a single journal or by a single author, that may be a sign you have some bias in your literature. Also, make sure that your searches are broad and don’t contain any words hinting at positive or negative connotations. There are times where you will want a certain connotation to learn more about a certain viewpoint, however make sure to balance this in your review.
