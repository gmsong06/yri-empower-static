You have a research question, you have read the literature around it, and now you come back to your initial idea. Do we need to redefine this project? And if so, how do we do that?

This is a question that practically every researcher will face at some point in their research journey. A project will go through many stages of evolution and at each part you will need to redefine it. In this lesson, we will discuss when to consider redefining your project and how to do so. 

When do we need to redefine the project?
-------------------------------

There are key points in your research journey where you will need to redefine your project. Below is how we define when to do so. 

1. Feasibility test: Is your project still feasible? Take a look at the last lesson to define this.
2. Is your project relevant? After all the literature review you did, does this still matter? And are you proposing a research question that isn’t “solved” and/or needs areas for improvement?
3. Is there a research project here? Is this something that the literature defines as an issue? 

If your answer is no to any of the above questions, you need to redefine your project. 

How do we redefine the project?
--------------------------

Now that we have encountered a moment where we need to redefine our project, let’s go through the steps of redefining it.

1. **Break your project down**: What kind of challenge did you face? If it was a feasibility challenge, in which your project was unrealistic or did not have the resources to complete it, the most common strategy is to break the project down. What was the limiting factor? For instance, if the issue was not having access to a certain dataset, then you will need to redefine the project and limit it’s scope to either using a different dataset, or not using a dataset at all. Was this a time challenge in which there was such a big research question that it was practically impossible to complete in the time period you have? How can you break this down further to make it more realistic?
2. **Replace the resources**: Is it possible to replace the resources that you don’t have? For instance, if I do not have a certain metal for my engineering project, can I instead make this a prototype and use a different more accessible material.
3. **Is this a knowledge challenge**: If you simply do not have enough expertise or manpower to get this project done in a realistic time-period, can you acquire mentors or assistance? Is there an alternative approach? Can you do a prototype instead? For instance, a project that would take expert programming knowledge when you do ont have the time to learn, can be challenging. 
4. **Repeat the feasibility check**: Once you have refined a new project, run the feasibility test again. If you find yourself running this test more than 3-5 times consecutively, you may need to reconsider the project as a whole and if it will be possible to complete even at the most basic level.

Overall, redefining a research project is very subjective. But it is critical to assess the feasibility early, and make sure you have the time, resources, and manpower to achieve the goal you desire. 

**When should I completely change my entire idea and scrap the one I had?** This is a common question and a process that is common in the research process. It’s difficult to assess this at times, and we often only realize this feasibility when we get to really understand the topic.

You should completely change your idea and scrap the one you had when you have attempted to break it down or redefine it several times and there is not a clear solution. In this case, it may simply be a resource challenge or issue that is unsolvable at your time of approach. 

This is something that can also be figured out by contacting a professional or mentor. They will often understand the undertaking of a project and redirect you accordingly.

Conclusion
--------------

To conclude, assessing when your project needs to be redefined based on feasibility is one of the most important and iterative processes of the research journey. You may go through 30 project changes throughout your research journey and maybe several of these come from that original research question. It’s critical to understand the challenge you are about to approach and whether this is something possible. The best and most common way to redefine is by breaking it down into more manageable steps. Remember, that you may feel lost or discouraged at times but to keep persevering as you will eventually find the perfect option for you.
