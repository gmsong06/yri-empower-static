Now that you have learned to do the literature review (check the last lesson out if you haven’t), let’s delve into learning the knowledge you need. In the research process, one of the most daunting factors is the amount of knowledge you need to learn. There are so many vocabulary words, techniques, and phrases that make absolutely no sense when we first glance at it. 

If you are feeling this way, don’t worry because we have all been here. The important thing to do is understand the techniques, tips, and strategies used to overcome this challenge. That is what we will discuss in this lesson: Learning the Minimum knowledge to Gain the Maximum Reward.

Understanding the information you need to know
--------------------------------

With so much information and concepts in a single research paper, we ask the question where to begin? Many of us will not have a PhD or have even completed highschool education yet so how do we learn what we need to know? How do we learn everything?

The strategy here is to not learn everything. If you are a highschooler, you most likely do not have the time, experience, and mentors to full-time teach you. Learning everything is practically impossible. Therefore, we use a trick called learning the minimum to gain the maximum. How this works is we learn as little as we need to know so we have a baseline on the field. Inorder to do this, follow these steps:

1. **State your subfield**: For example, if my subfield was connectomics then I would focus on this one. The subfield allows us to be more specific while also staying a bit broad. 
2. **Learn the main + base concepts**: The best way that many researchers go about this is a simple google search. An example of a potential search could be, “Key concepts in connectomics.” By doing this search, some research papers on the field will appear. In this case: https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/connectomics. You will want to read the overview, learn the basics. 
3. **Wikipedia dive**: This step is a trick that almost every top youth researcher does, and it works every time! You are going to search your subfield in Wikipedia and find it’s page. Then, you are going to read over the page and click on the hyperlinks until you understand the initial page! This may be wikipedia diving for hours or even days. In the connectomics example, I would look at this page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connectomics and dive through the hyperlinks and methods. 
4. **Build your tower**: You will not learn everything in the field. But, that is not the strategy here. We want to only learn what we need to know and now that we have the subfield base from steps 1-3, we can begin building our knowledge. There is no easy way to do this other than to begin reading! Jump into your literature and when you encounter an unexpected term or phrase, search it up! This process is exponential! The more you read, the less you have to search up and before you know it, navigating research papers and concepts will become second nature.
5. **Complimenting your search**: By using tools such as ChatGPT, you can speed this process up even further! If you are unsure of a topic, ask it to explain it to you “like a 4-year old”. This is a strategy even professionals use, and you can build your knowledge this way. 

Learning a concept/method you are going to use like Programming!
---------------------------------

Learning a concept or method that is more deep than just a vocabulary term or phrase takes a similar process. 

For instance, if I recognize that I need to know data-analysis for analyzing behavioral data, I can take the following approach. 
1. **Learn the basics**: It will be difficult to learn everything in the field as mentioned above so learn the basics and build for your use-case. DO NOT attempt to learn everything and then find what you need to use for a project; this is time wasting and confusing. For instance, if I need to learn how to analyze behavioral data using python I would take the following approach. First, learn the basics of python. Take a course! 
2. **Expand**: Once you have learned the basics, expand for your use case! I don’t need to learn all of data-analysis. Maybe, I just need to learn matplotlib. This is something you can find out by reading how other researchers did it for similar projects. Then build your knowledge and learn what is needed.

The key takeaways:

Do not learn everything. Learn the minimum of the field by going through wikipedia and general papers. You should be able to have a basic conversation. Your wikipedia dive especially, will teach you a lot. From here, build, build, build your knowledge. This will come from reading papers, having no idea what is being discussed, searching it up and asking ChatGPT, and repeating this process many times throughout your project. 

At the end of this, you will be a master of a very specific niche instead of the entire field and this will allow you to gain the maximum reward from the minimal knowledge.
