My experience in research was related to a competition I participated in with my team named the Conrad Challenge. The Conrad Challenge is a competition that requires innovation and entrepreneurship principles to solve a global issue. My team and I decided to enter the health and nutrition category where we developed an innovative breathalyzer which we called Respiralyze that offers a user-friendly and efficient solution for early lung cancer detection. From this challenge, we were able to attain the title of Conrad Innovator.

We chose to research a solution to the issue of lung cancer due to the risk it poses and how its presence can worsen symptoms and develop into later stages. Currently, smoking and vaping have been an exponential issue among the younger generations. With misleading advertisements and false claims regarding the safe nature of smoking devices, many are exposed to the harmful effects of ingesting such chemicals. Those who continue to use such products are at risk of respiratory cancer. By having a detection tool that is readily accessible, individuals have the chance to catch lung cancer at its earliest stages to improve the possibility of successful treatment. Additionally, our breathalyzer served to eliminate the issue of employing invasive testing in which medical employees utilize medical procedures that require cutting of the skin. A common invasive test used to diagnose a patient with lung cancer is called lung biopsy, in which a needle is used to remove a piece of skin. Biopsies are often associated with pain and can cause discomfort to the patient as a result. On the other hand, our early detection device serves as a non-invasive approach to diagnose a patient without additional pain or discomfort. 

Our research behind our breathalyzer centers around the detection of specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are markers for lung cancer. The specific VOC biomarkers associated with lung cancer consist of benzene derivatives and certain aldehydes, among other VOCs. Normally, a person’s breath contains about 3,000 VOCs which are created by numerous cellular metabolic pathways that are changed by cancer. When a person exhales through the mouthpiece, the multisensor array inside the breathalyzer detects and analyzes the volatile organic compounds, which are carbon-based gasses contained in a person’s breath. The multisensor array would be composed of carbon and polymer composites or metal oxides that would interact with each VOC, which causes a physical change in the sensor. The VOC would then attach and react on the composites to change their conductivity and electrical properties such as its resistance as they would be converted into electrical signals to create a breath print. However, depending on the level of VOC concentration in an individual, the sequence of the electrical current changes as the resistance changes. After this, the breath print would be connected to a pattern-recognition program consisting of machine-learning algorithms like support vector machines and neural networks to assist in large data processing for increased accuracy in diagnosing patients. These algorithms would also detect the breath prints to produce scores that are tailored to diseases from the combination of VOCs. This system, through its combination of sensor arrays and pattern recognition algorithms, is known as an electronic nose system. An electronic nose system is a type of sensing device that analyzes a person’s specific VOC composition and the types of VOC present for diagnostic motives and allows for a clear distinction between healthy patients and patients suffering from malignant tumors.

We executed our research by employing quantitative meta analysis to pull comprehensive research related to our topic from numerous studies and experiments. This allowed us to examine the relationship between the VOCs and lung cancer from different populations and samples. Also, we were able to determine which types of VOC are most commonly associated with lung cancer by researching its presence in healthy individuals versus people affected by lung cancer. As a result, we were able to identify the holes in past research and synthesize these results to create a solution. As part of our methods to validate our research, we have begun collecting breath samples and analyzing the VOC profiles of a diverse group of around a dozen individuals as part of our initial experiment. We then used a breath bag and collected the breaths from the populations to see which types of VOCs were most prevalent. 
Although we were able to complete our data collection stage, we were still in the process of developing a physical prototype. This required us to attain certain materials such as micro-pumps, flow controllers, and a sensor array that are not readily available.
