                                            A literature review is the process
                                            in which we learn what has already
                                            been done by reading many research
                                            papers and assessing the information
                                            available online. This allows us to
                                            gain an understanding of our field
                                            and improve our knowledge over our

                                            Here is how we suggest going through
                                            the research paper to save time and
                                            maximize information:

                                                introduction, brief methodology,
                                                and key results. It will also
                                                include terms that may be
                                                unknown to you and when first
                                                starting, it can be worthwhile
                                                to use tools such as ChatGPT to
                                                better understand the abstract
                                                or terms in it that are unknown
                                                to you. Over time, you will
                                                begin understanding more and
                                                more terms and reading abstracts
                                                will become even quicker and
                                                easier.

                                                add it to the literature review
                                                document. Some papers do not
                                                have a conclusion section

                                                overlooked when doing research,
                                                yet it is arguably the most
                                                important section. This part of
                                                a research paper reviews the
                                                results in context of the entire
                                                field and discusses future plans
                                                and areas for improvement. Ring
                                                any bells? This sounds a lot
                                                like an area for improvement and
                                                potentially another research

                                                also opens up potential new

                                                should only read what you are
                                                researching and nothing else.

                                            SciHub is one of the most popular
                                            tools in the research community.
                                            Many papers today are paywalled,
                                            making them difficult to access for
                                            the general public. Therefore,
                                            scihub was developed to alleviate
                                            this challenge and give access to
                                            papers that are behind a
                                            subscription/paywall. However, this
                                            is illegal so use it at your own
                                            discretion.

                                            The literature review is one of the
                                            most fundamental aspects of research
                                            and mastering this process is what
                                            often separates a novice from an
                                            experienced researcher. The concepts

                                            to the specialized tools and

                                            years of experience in moments.
                                            Through practice and developing your

                                            the overwhelming amount of
                                            literature on a subject?

                                            <strong>A:</strong> Make sure you
                                            have a clear and narrowed down
                                            research question. If you think it’s
                                            too broad and difficult to find
                                            specific literature, you may want to
                                            break it down further! Make sure
                                            that you are not keeping your
                                            searches too broad and try to make
                                            them as specific as possible! Read
                                            the abstracts to check for
                                            relevance, and organize using our

                                            <strong>Q:</strong> How do I find
                                            gaps in the literature if it doesn’t
                                            explicitly state it?

                                            <strong>A:</strong> This is a great
                                            question! Often, you need to look
                                            for synonyms such as “limiting”,
                                            “challenge”, “future work”,
                                            “unfortunately”. These key-words
                                            will bring forth areas for
                                            improvement and gaps in the
                                            literature. If your paper doesn’t
                                            include even these, you may want to
                                            look into a different paper however
                                            most of the time limitations will be
                                            listed.

                                            a lack of literature on a topic?

                                            <strong>A:</strong> This is a
                                            challenging situation you may run
                                            into, but it can also be a good
                                            thing! First, try and broaden your
                                            search. Sometimes it is too specific
                                            and yield little responses so
                                            expanding it a bit can provide more
                                            useful information. The next best
                                            thing you can do is contact an
                                            expert to learn more. Little
                                            literature can be valuable as there
                                            is more area for research to be
                                            done!

                                            sure my literature review is not
                                            biased?
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <strong>A:</strong> Make sure to
                                            read literature from multiple
                                            sources. If you find yourself
                                            looking at research papers in a
                                            single journal or by a single
                                            author, that may be a sign you have
                                            some bias in your literature. Also,
                                            make sure that your searches are
                                            broad and don’t contain any words
                                            hinting at positive or negative
                                            connotations. There are times where
                                            you will want a certain connotation
                                            to learn more about a certain
                                            viewpoint, however make sure to
                                            balance this in your review.
