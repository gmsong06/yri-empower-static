This is the final checklist that you should complete before starting your project. If your project does not fit all the criteria below, you should reevaluate your project. 

**Is this project scientifically sound?** This is one of the most basic checks and should probably already have been covered during your literature review? However, it is a good idea to evaluate here if your project as a whole makes sense. Are there too many confounding variables to isolate your target feature? Is the technology required for your project far beyond modern capabilities?

**Is your research question clear and well-defined?** Is the question that you’re trying to answer with your project specific and focused? If your question is more open-ended, you should reevaluate the goal of your research.

**Do you have the necessary skills and expertise?** Many scientists learn while doing their project. It is perfectly fine if you don’t have all the necessary skills. However, there should be some basic prerequisites. For example, if you are planning to do research on machine learning algorithms, you should probably know basic programming and software terms.

**Do you have access to sufficient materials to execute your plan?** In an arbitrary amount of time, do you have the equipment and materials to gather data of a quality high enough to answer your project’s central question?

**Can you feasibly complete your project in your planned time frame?** Yes, it is hard to look into the future, but from your current perspective, can you complete your project in the amount of time you’re planning (from the order of a few months to multiple years)? If the answer to this question is ‘no’ or becomes ‘no’ in the future, please consider de-scoping your project and focusing on solely the key parts.

**Have you identified potential ethical considerations?** This may not apply to all fields, but for projects particularly in biology or behavioral sciences, consider the ethical concerns for your projects. Will any animals or individuals be harmed by your project? Have you gotten IRB approval or consulted with any ethics boards?

**Is this project unique enough from past work?** While you shouldn’t always solely do research to do novel work, in many cases you probably should consider how different your proposed project is from previous work and how you can improve it/change it if not. To evaluate this, do a solid literature review of similar papers.
