Submission
============

Once you have prepared your manuscript and you’ve given it a good look over, you should be ready to submit. Before submitting, do a final formatting check where you ensure that your manuscript adheres to the journal’s formatting guidelines and that it contains no grammatical errors. Next, your journal should have a submission portal (Nature submission portal: https://mts-nature.nature.com/cgi-bin/main.plex). 

Follow the instructions on the submission button. Some journals support native submission from Overleaf directly, so check if your journal has that option as it can get rid of a lot of steps. Once you’ve clicked that submit button, you’ve just stepped foot into the world of professional academic research! Great job!

Waiting
==========
Often, especially for large journals, there can be a large time gap between initial submission and first review. Depending on the size of your journal and the size of your paper’s niche, this can take anywhere from 1 month to a year. It is important to stay patient under these circumstances. After submission, your document will go through the following steps:

* Initial editorial check (formatting guidelines, basic science, etc.)
* Reviewers are invited to edit your manuscript (typically SMEs)
* A reviewer(s) will accept and begin reviewing your manuscript
* Reviewer(s) will make their decision and send them to the assistant editor
* The assistant editor will make a decision on your paper based on reviewer feedback
* If your paper wasn’t rejected, make any suggested changes/tweaks
* Resubmit your paper to go through the review process again
* Repeat until acceptance

If a significantly large time has elapsed, you should email the assistant editor in charge of your manuscript to check in on your paper’s situation. **It is crucial to be polite, kind, and cordial in these interactions.** These editors are largely volunteers and are under significant amounts of stress, so be understanding in your correspondence. Below is a real sample email of this type of checking in:

.. tip::
    Dear Editorial Office, 
    
    |

    I'm [name], and I am the author of manuscript [ID]: [name]. I am writing this email to inquire on the status of my journal submission. As of tomorrow, I believe the paper will have been under review for 1 month (submitted ~2 months ago). I was wondering if there is a way I could potentially get more information about the progress of the reviewer(s) aside from the "Awaiting Reviewer Reports" status on the submission portal.

    No rush–I know this is near the end of the semester and many professors are quite busy, so I completely understand any decision delays.

    Thanks,

Responding to Reviewers
========================
Peer review is a critical component of the publication process. Responding to reviewers' comments can be challenging but is essential for improving the quality of your paper. When going through a reviewer’s comments, you should strive to understand each comment and the rationale behind it. You should also be respectful and professional and address each comment politely, even if you disagree. When editing your manuscript, comment or notate the changes you have made or justify why certain changes are not possible. 

.. tip::
    **Reviewer 1:** The introduction section lacks clarity on the research question.

    **Response**: We have revised the introduction to clearly state the research question and its significance. (See page 2, lines 15-20)

Trying Again
=============
As we have mentioned multiple times, there is a high likelihood you will be rejected, given that this will likely be your first paper. Do NOT be discouraged. The authors of this guide themselves have been rejected, and their best advice is to improve on your paper and then resubmit to another journal. 

Remember, never give up.
