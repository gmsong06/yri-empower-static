This is where your literature review comes back in again. You’ve conducted your experiment, you’ve analyzed your data, and you’ve drawn conclusions from said data. But how does that tie into the wider context of your research field?It is paramount to develop an understanding of the significance of one’s research as it critically provides an approach to future research directions. Overall, you must consider your background research as a sounding board for the significance of your validatory or field-advancing findings. These findings also need to be considered in a way to is applicable across different fields of science and mathematics, if possible. 

Tying back to Background Research
==============================

After conducting a literature review and reading abundant relevant articles, you should be well-versed in the topic you are researching. With this broadened understanding, your results will be much easier to understand. First of all, you must compare your research findings to other scientists who have conducted similar published studies; for example, if you were to evaluate the growth of a plant after being in the sun, it would be recommended to evaluate how that specific plant's growth compares to similar research. This comparative analysis develops the significance of your research by allowing for statements that show how your findings are similarly found in other research environments. 

Ideally you, as a researcher, should know your new target to broaden the field. You would have to go back a few steps and re-think other fields that could be targeted. These fields could be related indirectly or directly as long as there is a connection to the application of your research. You could have practical approaches or even theoretical approaches. This all needs to be adjusted according to your new audience. Additionally, you also need to know how to compare the fields.

It's a good idea to go through related research to see how they applied research of similar topics. This might help your research in finding ways to apply to similar fields. Having profound knowledge on the subject on its own will help in finding applicability to wider fields as well. 

Future Directions
===============

Once the results are gathered and the majority of the intensive processes are over, it is time to begin thinking about the future directions that you could take your research in. Your results and general thoughts about experimentation are the best way to evaluate where you can take your project. For example, if I believe that my research was very intensive and prone to many errors, as similarly shown in the statistical analysis of results, a future direction I would take is a more simplistic study design. This example is simply one of the many critiques one can have regarding their research. This reflection process can allow for budding researchers to advance the scientific significance of their research and create a greater impact overall. 

Future Implications
===================

One of the key parts of research is to identify a gap in knowledge in which to investigate, and once you have obtained your results, it is comparable to placing the keystone in a stone bridge. These findings can be implicated in numerous other fields of research as well if used correctly. Furthermore, the results become the sounding board for others, supporting the research of many people across the globe if they are publicized as well. In sum, your research should be understood to have a wider significance than the direct issue or knowledge gab that you are addressing, be it creating a greater understanding of the brain or optimizing a certain type of machine.
