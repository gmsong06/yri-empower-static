Be Adaptive
========

Your project will most likely be harder than you expect. At some points, you may find yourself weeks, even months behind schedule. Do not worry. This is the nature of research. Science is about trial and error, especially the error. If you realize suddenly that a part of your project is infeasible or too unrealistic, do not be afraid to make changes. That is the nature of science–continually iterating upon your failures.


Reach Out
========

If you do not understand something in a procedure you’re trying to replicate, or an equation that you don’t understand in a paper, reach out. Professors are happy to talk to you about their research and they will be willing to answer most questions. Don’t be afraid to just shoot out an email an inquire about a question you had in a paper of theirs from 6 years ago (true story!).

.. tip::

   Dear Dr. [name], 

   |

   I am [your name], a [position] conducting research on [topic]. During my literature review, I came across your paper [title]. I know this is from quite a while back, but I was curious as to how you [question].

   [clarification question]? I would love some more details.

   Thanks,

   [your name]


Don't Get Stuck
========

If you are stuck on a particular section of your project and you’ve spent a particularly long amount of time on it, it may be a good idea to move on to another aspect of your project before coming back. If the step you’re stuck on is a bottleneck, take a break from your project. Go on a walk or do some external activity because it may help clear your mind.

Keep Logs
========

It is good practice to keep written or digital logs of the work that you are doing. Doing so makes it significantly easier to revisit and rethink ideas. It also serves as evidence for your hard work. When you have finally finished your project, you can look back on them and see how far you’ve come.
