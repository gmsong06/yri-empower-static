I want you to imagine a star that you couldn’t see even if you were right next to it. A star that is so cold that it can support life in its clouds. A star that’s invisible to our eyes. How do you find something that you can’t see? Ultracool brown dwarfs may be some of the most elusive objects in modern astronomy. They straddle the line between planet and star; too hot to be a planet yet too cool to be a star. The coldest ones emit light mostly in the infrared, making them hard to distinguish in a night sky full with the light from distant galaxies and luminescent quasars. When I first undertook this project in 2022, only 32 of the coldest type of brown dwarf had been found. The elusive nature of these objects fascinated me; It was like a mystery waiting to be solved. I wanted to create a technique that could find more. 

Starting my project was difficult. First of all, I had next to no knowledge about brown dwarfs or even astronomy in general. The little knowledge I had was cobbled together from watching NOVA documentaries on the couch with my parents when I was younger. Second of all, the only coding knowledge I had was from a basic Python textbook that I couldn’t bother to read half of. But the internet was my best friend. Every search query was a dive into an encyclopedia of information that I couldn’t hope to gather from one textbook alone. The nature of astronomy projects are interesting, because frequently they don’t involve experimental trials or the hallmarks of most other fields. The development process is mostly iterative. I would write a section of a Jupyter Notebook, pray it ran, and then would stare at the screen in glum disappointment at the “Kernel crashed” message. I would then copy paste the traceback into Google and hope with my dear life that someone on Stack Overflow had encountered the same issue years back. 

The core idea of my project relied on modeling. See, to train a system to find these ultracool brown dwarfs, you need an adequate training set. Unfortunately, that training set (empirical detection) is composed of a few dozen objects rather than the preferable few hundred or few thousand. As a result, I needed to create synthetic modeled data. The issue with that is modeling requires significant amounts of math, which I admittedly, am terrible at. I remember that the entire month of November was spent hunched over a single paper, trying to decipher one equation. Fortunately, I’ve learned from that experience to email authors when you don’t understand something, but to freshman-year me, professors were big scary monsters I shouldn’t dare bother. 

Eventually, I figured out the equation and finished modeling the brown dwarfs. However, there was still one problem left–using the models to actually create a system that could find these objects. My preferred method of choice was an ensemble classifier of multiple machine learning models. Unfortunately, I was still very much a Python beginner who had no right attempting to code deep neural networks when I didn’t even know how to properly access an element from a Numpy array. But one thing I learned from this project was to never stop trying. I probably spent a month digesting machine learning concepts, the frameworks involved, and such. And when my classifier finally ran, it felt like heaven. I remember immediately rushing downstairs to my parents and dragging them over to my computer to see the brown dwarfs I had just discovered. That feeling of elation will never leave me. 

That March, I was selected to attend the International Science and Engineering Fair (ISEF), where I secured 3rd place in my category along with a special award. Currently, this research is undergoing revisions for publication in an astronomy journal. There were so many points throughout the journey where I could have given up, but if there’s anything this project taught me, it’s that you just have to keep trying.
