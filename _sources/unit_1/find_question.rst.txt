Identifying the right research question is a daunting task that we talked about a little in the last lesson. This process involves assessing the literature, comprehending areas for improvement, and also keeping in mind our specificity. Let’s delve into the process of finding the right question and the checklist to making sure your question is the right one for you!

Identifying Your Question
-----------------------
Finding the right research question is critical. This question should present/address gaps in knowledge that require further inquiry. Revisit the last section to find out how to use literature review to find potential questions!

1. Begin searching for themes that can bring light to a potential research question. An example is: “Challenges in computational neuroscience”, “Grand challenges in proteomics”, “Unsolved questions in computer vision”. These types of searches bring relevant information to your eyes. These however, are very big and extensive questions. An unsolved challenge in computational neuroscience could be multi-scale modeling. This is a huge challenge, and likely unsolvable at an early stage. Instead, we will look deeper into these questions which leads us to step 2.
2. Now that you have searched for key questions in your subfield, you are going to begin reading papers and wikipedia diving into the challenge/topic. For instance, if the challenge is multi-scale modeling in computational neuroscience, I am going to search up “Multi-scale modeling attempts.pdf”. This will show us what people have tried and bring up a research paper. Now, a research paper has a lot of information. We are going to only look at 3 places. The abstract, the introduction, and the discussion. The discussion is where you can find your research question! This will tell you what the current study lacked, and the challenges they faced at a more specific level. 
3. As you are going through papers and looking at their areas for improvement, wrote them down in a chart to reference later. Wikipedia will be your best friend as well. Use it in conjunction to read about your topic. For instance, if my topic is multi-scale modeling, I will open the Wikipedia page for it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiscale_modeling. Then, I will read this and use the hyper-links to delve deeper into the topic. The page itself will tell you about potential challenges and areas for improvement. You can also learn vocabulary by tapping on a topic keyword and learning what it means. Keep these points in mind: 

At this point in your research, you will have many different challenges and questions you have noticed in the literature. Perhaps you only have a couple but that is because there is not a lot of diversity in your field. Both are fine! Now finding which question is the right one, can be done with the following process. 

- **Relevance**: Is your question relevant/significant to your respective field of study?

- **Feasibility**: Is your question something practical or something you can accomplish; do you have the necessary resources and can this be done in a reasonable timeline? How much time do you have to do this project and how long do you want to spend?

- **Clarity**: Is your question clearly articulated; would other individuals be able to clearly reflect on the purpose of your research? Is it specific enough to guide the formulation of a hypothesis?>

If your answer is no to any of these, ask the question why? Let’s look at each point. For Relevance, if your question is not relevant to your field don't immediately cross it out but ask why. Is there a variation to this question I can ask that would make it more significant? If not, cross it out! Is this feasible? If not, don’t cross it out yet. Ask the question, can I break this down further to make it more feasible. Most of the time, the answer is yes but if not you may want to cross it out! Finally, does my question have clarity and make sense? Is this something irrelevant, or would a researcher understand the challenge? If not, don’t cross out immediately but instead try to redefine the question by thinking about it in the context of other researchers. How can I explain this to a 5 year old? How can I rephrase this question so that it makes more sense and is phrased more relevant to my field? If your question is completely ambiguous, you may need to cross it out. 

When coming up with a research question, it’s difficult to get it right on the first try and you will get better at this the more you continue. The trick is iteration. Editing, redefining, removing, assessing pros and cons when comparing multiple ideas, and contact experts are all a part of this initial process. For some, it may take 3 iterations and for others your question might change 5-10 times! The important thing is to feel confident about your question and keep an open mind. This is an important step, so don't rush it!
