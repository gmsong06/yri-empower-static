The purpose of a literature review is to validate the study’s arguments, which should have a basis. A proper literature review will provide better consistency and truthfulness to the study as well. 

A preliminary literature review is a type of literature review we researchers do before coming up with a project idea! Why do we do a literature review?:

- Understand our topic a lot better
- Allows us to assess the state of our field and where we can contribute 
- Provides proper support for the argument


Where to Begin?
----------------

The first step in conducting a preliminary literature review is to define your objective. Because this is a preliminary literature review, most of us will not have a complete research question layed out. We will have some subtopics and areas that we are interested in. To proceed from here, you will need to learn more about your topic. The best way to do this is through research papers, wikipedia, and contacting professionals!

Here is an example: My interest is connectomics. Now what I am going to do is look at the wikipedia page for connectomics. I am also going to search up questions such as “Key challenges in connectomics.” By delving into the literature by reading and taking notes, you will begin to notice challenges and trends. This may not be obvious or apparent at first but through the entire process you will notice trends. 

Begin by creating a document titled Literature Review. Follow this template which works for many top researchers:

Key Things to Look for in Literature 
----------------------------------
There is a lot of literature in practically every area of science! How do we traverse this to find out what is important and relevant to us? First things first, remember the objective. We are looking for a research question, idea, or area for improvement. When looking at the vast amount of literature, it is important to keep this goal in mind and filter information out. This is how we go about that process:

1. Begin searching for themes that can bring light to a potential research question. An example is: “Challenges in computational neuroscience”, “Grand challenges in proteomics”, “Unsolved questions in computer vision”. These types of searches bring relevant information to your eyes. These however, are very big and extensive questions. An unsolved challenge in computational neuroscience could be multi-scale modeling. This is a huge challenge, and likely unsolvable at an early stage. Instead, we will look deeper into these questions which leads us to step 2.
2. Now that you have searched for key questions in your subfield, you are going to begin reading papers and wikipedia diving into the challenge/topic. For instance, if the challenge is multi-scale modeling in computational neuroscience, I am going to search up “Multi-scale modeling attempts.pdf”. This will show us what people have tried and bring up a research paper. Now, a research paper has a lot of information. We are going to only look at 3 places. The abstract, the introduction, and the discussion. The discussion is where you can find your research question! This will tell you what the current study lacked, and the challenges they faced at a more specific level. 
3. As you are going through papers and looking at their areas for improvement, wrote them down in a chart to reference later. Wikipedia will be your best friend as well. Use it in conjunction to read about your topic. For instance, if my topic is multi-scale modeling, I will open the wikepedia page for it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiscale_modeling. Then, I will read this and use the hyper-links to delve deeper into the topic. The page itself will tell you about potential challenges and areas for improvement. You can also learn vocabulary by tapping on a topic keyword and learning what it means. 

Key words in the literature to look for: “Lacking”, “Room for improvement”, “Limiting”, “Future-work”. These terms will direct you towards issues researchers have ran into and a potential area for research! 

**Quick Tip**: Use ChatGPT to your advantage. Even today, doing literature review is a long but rewarding process. It can be confusing at first, but tools like chatgpt can help you narrow down your search. It’s important to use it ethically, but this tool can teach you about concepts that were challenging, redirect you to hot-topics, and answer questions you wouldn't find in the literature. Use this tool to guide you!

At the end of this process, you should hopefully have a research topic that interests you and a question that you have identified as a gap in the literature or room for improvement. 

Beyond the Literature: Top Tip
--------------------------------
There is a ton of literature available and doing this review is critical. However, a tip that top researchers use to get a grasp on their field is contacting experts! This is something many people often miss, and by contacting your field experts you can learn more about challenges they face in their daily lives! We suggest doing a preliminary literature review, and as you find a field you are interested in, email around 50-100 professors in that field and ask if they have time to discuss! These mentors can become contacts and places to reach out too when you have other questions or need resources. The following template can be used to email professors regarding their field:

.. tip::
    Dear Dr. Their Name,

    My name is Your Name, and I am a high school student (or whichever grade) with a keen interest in your field of interest and sub-field. I am writing to request a brief call with you to gain insights into the major challenges and issues currently facing the field.

    I am particularly inspired by the advancements made through projects like AlphaFold [replace with a more relevant topic that inspired you] and am eager to understand how researchers address similar problems in neuroscience. Your expertise in their field ______ makes you an ideal person to provide valuable insights.

    I would greatly appreciate it if you could spare 15-20 minutes for a quick call at your convenience. Your guidance would be instrumental in helping me understand the critical issues and how I might contribute to this field in the future. My resume and CV are also attached in case you need to review them before scheduling a meeting.

    Thank you very much for considering my request. I look forward to the possibility of speaking with you soon.

    Best regards, 

    Your Name

Conclusion/Summary on Preliminary Literature Review
-----------------------------------------------
Doing a preliminary literature review can be a daunting task at first but think of it as something fun. The following methods will help you navigate this process:

- Search and/or use chat gpt to find challenges in your subfield and field of popularity.
- Read introduction, abstract, and discussion of the recent research papers and note down the limitations and key take aways in a literature review document
- Use wikipedia as your friend to delve deep into your subfield and note down terms, new vocabulary, and challenges you notice!
- Contact specialists in your field to learn more about challenges they face from day to day. These can become future mentors!

Take your time with the process and enjoy it! You will learn an amazing amount.
